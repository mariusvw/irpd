This document will explain how to configure the irp CGI interface to run with mod_perl.

I highly recommend using mod_perl as it creates a huge performance increase in the cgi execution.

First, the requirements:

1. Apache.  (I recommend 1.3.12 or later.  i use 1.3.19.)
2. mod_perl.  (I am using the latest version 1.25.)
3. some familiarity with configuring apache.

First thing you must do is get Apache running with mod_perl, if you dont have that already.  Once that's done, configuring Apache is fairly easy.

In your Apache configuration file (usually $ServerRoot/conf/httpd.conf), make an entry like this:

<Location /irp>
   SetHandler perl-script
   PerlRequire /usr/local/irpd/modperl/startup.pl
   PerlHandler IRP::Apache
</Location>

Now, just restart Apache, and use a web browser to request http://yourserver.com/irp and you will have your irp cgi running in mod_perl.
enjoy.
