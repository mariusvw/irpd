Be sure to read README.

To install irpd, simply copy the contents of this directory to /usr/local/irpd.

Steps:
1. untar the tarball.
2. execute install.sh as root.
(this is a simple three line sh script that creates /usr/local/irpd and copies all files to that new directory - if you already have a /usr/local/irpd, you can just copy everything there by hand, but make sure you get the .irpd_release file)
Files are:
zrn-irpd - main script that runs the streamer and the irpd server.
irpd.conf - configuration file, edit this.
irp.cgi - CGI interface for the radio station.
IRP/Commands.pm - perl module containing the subroutines that handle the irpd server commands.
IRP/Files.pm - perl module with the irp file manipulation routines.
IRP/Globals.pm - the global variables.
IRP/Interface.pm - some subroutines to format output for displaying.
IRP/Apache.pm - the Apache perl module interface to run under mod_perl.

See the README for info on the irpd.conf file, edit that for your purposes, then execute zrn-irpd as root to start up the stream.

Additionally, if you want to install the CGI:
Either make the /usr/local/irpd directory available to your webserver (with rights to execute CGI's), or better, copy irp.cgi to a location you already have configured.

NEW with version 0.2: apache module using mod_perl
This has the exact same functionality as the CGI, but I highly recommend you run this as its about 3-4x faster.
To install this, see README in the modperl directory...its not too hard.

NOTE If you do not install to /usr/local/irpd, you need to edit:
- zrn-irpd:8,31,32
- irpd.conf:9
[if you use the CGI]
 - irp.cgi:9,20
[if you use the modperl module]
 - modperl/startup.pl:2
 - IRP/Apache.pm:21
